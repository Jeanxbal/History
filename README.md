Delete History navigation 
I can no more delete the history of navigation !

How must i do ?

Normaly i can delete routes from history in the Search menu, wen i go to the Menu->Search->History and make a long tap on any search result. Then, press Select All option and press the Trash button but it don't work.
i have found another way param√®tre/ osmand parametres/history but it is not the normally way
